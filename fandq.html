<div><h3>What's written in Quran?</h3></div>
<p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam, and it contains the teachings and guidance of Allah (God) as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. The Quran is written in Arabic and is divided into 114 chapters, or surahs, each containing verses, or ayahs.

    Muslims believe that the Quran is the literal word of God, and they consider it to be the final and complete revelation of God to humanity. They also believe that it is a source of guidance and wisdom for all people, regardless of their race, nationality, or background.</p>

    <div><h3>What science is in the Quran?</h3></div>
    <p>The Quran is primarily a religious text that provides guidance and teachings for Muslims. While it does mention certain scientific concepts, it is not considered to be a scientific text.

        The Quran contains references to various natural phenomena and scientific concepts such as astronomy, embryology, geology, and cosmology. These references are often presented in a poetic or metaphorical style, and are intended to emphasize the greatness and power of God as the creator of the universe.
        
        However, it is important to note that the Quran is not a comprehensive scientific text, nor does it provide detailed explanations or descriptions of scientific phenomena. The scientific knowledge that is mentioned in the Quran is often presented in a simplified form, and may not always be consistent with current scientific understanding.
        
        Therefore, while the Quran may contain some references to science, it is primarily a religious text that is intended to provide spiritual guidance and moral teachings to Muslims.</p>
        <div><h3>What are the parts of Quran?</h3></div>
        <p>The Quran, which is the holy scripture of Islam, is divided into 114 chapters, also known as Surahs. These Surahs are further divided into verses, known as Ayat. In total, the Quran has 6,236 verses.

            Each Surah of the Quran is named after a particular topic or theme, and they vary in length from just a few verses to over 200 verses. The longest Surah of the Quran is Surah Al-Baqarah, which contains 286 verses, while the shortest Surah is Surah Al-Kawthar, which has just three verses.
            
            The Surahs of the Quran are arranged in order of decreasing length, with the exception of the first Surah, Surah Al-Fatiha, which is a short prayer recited at the beginning of each of the five daily prayers.
            
            The Quran is considered the primary source of Islamic beliefs, ethics, and laws. Muslims believe that the Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad by the Angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years, and it is regarded as the literal word of God, as revealed to the Prophet.</p>
            <div><h3>What does ق mean in Quran?</h3></div>
            <p>The symbol "ق" (pronounced "qaf") is a letter in the Arabic alphabet and is used extensively in the Quran, the holy book of Islam. It is the nineteenth letter of the Arabic alphabet and is used to represent the sound "q" as in "qalam" (pen) or "qalb" (heart).

                In the Quran, the letter "ق" appears in numerous words, including the name of the Surah (chapter) 50, which is called "Qaf". The symbol also appears in various other words such as "Qur'an" (the holy book), "maqam" (station), and "qiyamah" (Judgment Day).
                
                It is important to note that each letter of the Arabic alphabet has its own distinct sound and significance in the Quran. Muslims believe that the Quran is the word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and therefore, each letter and word in the Quran is considered to be of great importance and significance.</p>

                <div><h3>How many eyes are there in Quran?</h3></div>
                <p>The Quran, which is the central religious text of Islam, does not mention the exact number of eyes in a definitive or literal sense. However, the Quran uses the term "eye" or "eyes" in various contexts throughout its verses, often symbolically or metaphorically.

                    For example, the Quran refers to the "eyes of the disbelievers" (47:20) and the "eye of the heart" (22:46) as a symbol of perception and understanding. The Quran also describes Allah's all-seeing and all-knowing nature as the "eyes of Allah" (40:20).
                    
                    Therefore, it would not be accurate to give a specific number of eyes mentioned in the Quran since the use of the term "eye" is more symbolic than literal.</p>

                    <div><h3>Why should we study Quran?
                    </h3></div>
                    <p>There are many reasons why someone might choose to study the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam. Here are a few of the most important ones:

                        <div><h3>Which is the longest āyāt in Quran?</h3></div>
                        <p>The longest āyāt (verse) in the Quran is Ayat al-Kursi (the Verse of the Throne), which is the 255th verse of Surah Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2).

The verse describes the greatness and power of Allah (God), and it is often recited for protection and as a supplication.</p>


                        <div><h3>Which surah is for success?</h3></div>
                        <p>In Islam, all the Surahs (chapters) of the Quran have their own virtues and blessings, and there is no particular Surah that is exclusively for success. However, some Surahs are recommended to recite for seeking success and blessings from Allah.

                            One such Surah is Surah Al-Fatiha (the opening chapter of the Quran), which is considered the greatest Surah of the Quran and is also known as "Ummul Kitab" (the mother of the book). It is recommended to recite this Surah in every prayer, and it is also believed to be effective in seeking blessings and success in life.
                            
                            Another Surah that is commonly recited for success is Surah Yasin. It is believed to have numerous virtues and benefits, including the reward of reciting it being equivalent to reading the Quran ten times. Reciting this Surah with sincerity and faith is believed to bring success and blessings from Allah.
                            
                            Apart from these, there are many other Surahs in the Quran that are recommended to recite for seeking success, such as Surah Al-Waqiah, Surah Al-Ikhlas, and Surah Al-Kafirun, among others. It is important to remember that seeking success and blessings ultimately comes from Allah, and the most important thing is to have sincere faith and trust in Him.</p>


                            <div><h3>What are the miracles of Quran?</h3></div>
                            <p>The Quran itself is considered a miracle in Islam due to its linguistic, literary, and scientific aspects. Here are some of the main miracles of the Quran:

                                Linguistic Miracle: The Quran is considered a linguistic miracle due to its unique style, eloquence, and beauty. It is written in classical Arabic, and its poetic verses are said to be unmatched in the Arabic language. The Quran's literary beauty and eloquence have been recognized by Arabic scholars throughout history.
                                
                                Scientific Miracles: The Quran contains numerous scientific facts that were not discovered until many centuries after it was revealed. For example, the Quran describes the development of the embryo in the mother's womb and the stages of human development, which were only discovered by modern science in the 20th century.
                                
                                Prophecies: The Quran contains many prophecies that have come true. For example, it predicted the defeat of the Persians by the Romans, which came true in the 7th century.
                                
                                Ethical and Moral Teachings: The Quran contains many teachings about ethical and moral behavior that have been recognized as universal principles. It emphasizes justice, compassion, and respect for others, and it provides guidance on how to live a good life.

                                <div><h3>What are the rules of the Quran?
                                </h3></div>
                                <p>The Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, contains guidance and teachings for Muslims to live their lives according to the will of Allah (God). It lays down principles and guidelines for Muslims to follow in all aspects of their lives. Some of the key rules of the Quran include:

                                    Belief in Allah: The Quran emphasizes the importance of believing in the oneness of Allah and submitting to His will.
                                    
                                    Prayer: Muslims are required to pray five times a day, facing towards the Kaaba in Mecca.
                                    
                                    Fasting: Muslims are required to fast during the month of Ramadan, abstaining from food and drink from dawn until sunset.
                                    
                                    Charity: Muslims are encouraged to give to charity and help those in need.
                                    
                                    Hajj: Muslims who are physically and financially able are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime.
                                    
                                    Prohibition of certain acts: The Quran prohibits certain acts such as drinking alcohol, gambling, and engaging in sexual relations outside of marriage.
                                    
                                    Good deeds: The Quran emphasizes the importance of performing good deeds and treating others with kindness and compassion.
                                    
                                    These are just some of the main rules and principles outlined in the Quran. Muslim scholars have also developed a body of jurisprudence called Shariah, which is based on the Quran and provides more detailed guidance on how Muslims should conduct themselves in all aspects of their lives.</p>

                                    <div><h3>Which is older the Quran or the Bible?</h3></div>
                                    <p>The Bible is older than the Quran in terms of when the texts were written. The texts that make up the Old Testament of the Christian Bible were written between approximately 1200 BCE and 165 BCE, while the texts that make up the New Testament were written between approximately 50 CE and 100 CE.

                                        On the other hand, the Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years, beginning in 610 CE and ending with his death in 632 CE. The Quran was then compiled into a complete book form during the reign of the third caliph, Uthman, in the mid-7th century CE.
                                        
                                        So while the Bible is older in terms of when the texts were written, the Quran is still considered a very old and important religious text in its own right.</p>

                                        <div><h3>What Quran says about life?</h3></div>
                                        <p>The Quran is the holy book of Islam and provides guidance and teachings on a wide range of topics, including the meaning and purpose of life. Here are some of the key teachings from the Quran on life:

                                            Life is a gift from God: The Quran teaches that God is the creator of all life and that He has given humans the gift of life as a test. This means that we are accountable for our actions and will be judged based on how we lived our lives.
                                            
                                            Life is temporary: The Quran emphasizes that life on earth is temporary and that our ultimate destination is the afterlife. This means that we should focus on doing good deeds and seeking God's pleasure in order to prepare for the eternal life in the hereafter.
                                            
                                            Life is a test: The Quran teaches that life is a test and that we will face trials and tribulations in order to strengthen our faith and character.
